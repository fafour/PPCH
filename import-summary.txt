ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => libraryProject/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => libraryProject/src/main/assets
* libs/commons-codec-1.6.jar => libraryProject/libs/commons-codec-1.6.jar
* libs/commons-io-2.4.jar => libraryProject/libs/commons-io-2.4.jar
* libs/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar => libraryProject/libs/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
* libs/fluent-hc-4.2.5.jar => libraryProject/libs/fluent-hc-4.2.5.jar
* libs/httpclient-4.3.3.jar => libraryProject/libs/httpclient-4.3.3.jar
* libs/httpclient-cache-4.2.5.jar => libraryProject/libs/httpclient-cache-4.2.5.jar
* libs/httpcore-4.3.2.jar => libraryProject/libs/httpcore-4.3.2.jar
* libs/httpmime-4.3.3.jar => libraryProject/libs/httpmime-4.3.3.jar
* libs/volley.jar => libraryProject/libs/volley.jar
* lint.xml => libraryProject/lint.xml
* res/ => libraryProject/src/main/res/
* src/ => libraryProject/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => libraryProject/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/co/.DS_Store => libraryProject/src/main/resources/co/.DS_Store
* src/co/th/.DS_Store => libraryProject/src/main/resources/co/th/.DS_Store
* src/co/th/nister/.DS_Store => libraryProject/src/main/resources/co/th/nister/.DS_Store
* src/co/th/nister/libraryproject/.DS_Store => libraryProject/src/main/resources/co/th/nister/libraryproject/.DS_Store
* src/co/th/nister/libraryproject/component/.DS_Store => libraryProject/src/main/resources/co/th/nister/libraryproject/component/.DS_Store
* src/com/.DS_Store => libraryProject/src/main/resources/com/.DS_Store
* src/com/android/.DS_Store => libraryProject/src/main/resources/com/android/.DS_Store

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
